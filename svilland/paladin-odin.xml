            <p>Alles who swear their oath to Odin become his emissaries, and guardians in the realm. They lead the folks against Odin’s enemies.</p>
			<p class="indent">They yearn for wisdom, acting cautiously in the face of any kind of challenge, rather than behaving recklessly. This is because they know more about Odin than the other Svillanders. They know the Allfather seeks sacred lore, and they know that he is the master of tricking fools.</p>
			<p class="indent">Before they strike, they try to listen and understand. However, they do not hesitate once they decide to do something.</p>
             <h5 class="caption">CHANGES IN FEATURES</h5>
			 <p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Smite and Improved Divine Smite.</em></strong> You deal psychic damage rather than radiant damage with Divine Smite and Improved Divine Smite.</p>
			 <h5 class="caption">TENETS OF ODIN</h5>
            <p>Odin’s teachings are traditions of Svillanders. However, the highest ranking ruler of Valhalla does not restrain the mind of those devoted to him, and he gives them free will to find their own paths to find wisdom. Still, his essence is based on the following tenets:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Practice wisdom. </i></b>
                 The wisest shall dine closest to the Allfather. Act with wisdom and with clarity. Always seek new knowledge and equip yourself with the knowledge available in your realm. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Listen to the ravens. </i></b>
                 The Allfather loves to communicate with his children and to guide them. Pay attention to ravens and other omens around you.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Understand Allfather’s Kingdom. </i></b>
                No Gods, Goddesses, or creatures are above his might. He has plans for everyone and everything. Do not fear those who threaten the pantheon, they are just fools playing their parts.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Trade respect. </i></b>
                Act in a respectful manner to others and ask to be treated with respect in return. Your duty to the Allfather requires you to inspire majesty.
            </p>

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Cosmic Affinity.</em></strong> As a bonus action, you say a prayer to Odin and can cast a spell that normally requires you to take one action.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Turn the Heathen.</em></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak the prayer of Allfather’s conquest, using your Channel Divinity. Each fey or fiend that can see or hear you within 30 feet must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move into a space within a 30-foot-radius. It also can’t take reactions. As its action, it can only choose to Dash or to try to escape from the effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use Dodge as its action.</p>
