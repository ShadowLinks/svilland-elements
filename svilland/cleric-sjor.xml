			<p class="flavor">Will of the Sea.</p>
			<p>The Sjor domain focuses on the vast waters and seas surrounding Svilland. It holds the power of Aegir, through water creatures and the might of its seas. Aegir grants this domain to his followers so that they carry the will of the sea within them. They can smite those who dare stand against the might of Aegir; who states that everything came from the water and that water can destroy just as it created; a property that is only held back by Aegir’s mercy.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to invoke the wrath of your God and the seas. As an action, you magically summon the mighty waves from the sea. The waves emerge from your location, move out in a 30-foot radius centered on you, and strike the hostile creatures. A creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 2d10 force damage and is washed out of the area and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the damage is halved and the creature is not washed away and is not knocked prone.</p>

			<p>Starting at 6th level, you are blessed by Aegir and your fighting techniques represent the will of the seas. When you make a weapon attack, you can choose to expend a 1st level spell slot and imbue your weapon with the power of the crashing waves. If you do so, you deal 1d6 force damage with the attack and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. When you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, as long as you stand in a body of water that covers half your body, you have resistance to fire damage.</p>
