			<p>Those who follow Skadi’s Way are rangers that are not only able to survive in extremely cold regions but who also wield the might of winter. They generally defend the villages on the outskirts of Svilland against the dangers and monsters related to the cold, such as frost jotunns. They can survive in harsh winters and bring the cold down upon their foes through various tactics and spells.</p>
			<p class="indent">These rangers get their name from the deity Skadi, the Goddess of bowhunting, skiing, winter and mountains.</p>
