			<p>At 2nd level, you learn how to empower the runes with your own blood. While casting a spell from your runelist, you can choose to a scar yourself and make your spell more powerful. You deal a spell level amount of necrotic damage to yourself and the DC of the spell you cast increases by 1. The damage cannot be reduced by any means.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, when you drop a creature to 0 hit points by using a spell from your runelist, you regain hit points equal to the level of the spell.</p>
