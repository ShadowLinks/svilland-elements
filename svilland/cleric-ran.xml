			<p>Ran is the Lady of the Depths. She rules the seas with her husband, Aegir, and yet, she is different from Aegir; her methods are hollower and probably more wicked.</p>
			<p class="indent">She likes to carry unaware sailors into the seas’ depths, convert them into undead servants for eternity, and loot their treasure to put them into Aegir’s treasure.</p>
			<p class="indent">Her domain focuses on the haunting charm of the depths she controls, causing bodies to wither and minds to melt with the charm of the Lady of the Depths. Her devotees spread her presence wherever possible, and trade power for Aegir’s Gold, which they sacrifice to their lady.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 1st level, you learn the sacred ritual of sailors that blesses you with gold from Aegir’s treasures.</p>
			<p class="indent">By expending a spell slot and performing a 10-minute ritual in which you paint the gold pieces with your own blood, you convert a number of gold pieces that are equal to the expended slot level into a special token called Aegir’s Gold.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can then trade these gold pieces with Ran in exchange for her aid and gain one of the following benefits;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>By spending 1 Aegir’s Gold as a reaction, you can increase the spell save DC or spell attack modifier of your next spell by 2.</li>
				<li>By spending 1 Aegir’s Gold as a reaction, you can cast a spell that requires a material component worth less than or equal to 50 gold pieces without using the material component.</li>
				<li>By spending 1 Aegir’s Gold as a bonus action, you can make a weapon attack as a part of the same action.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="indent">An Aegir’s gold can only be used by the gothi who created them. For others, they carry the same monetary value as a normal gold piece. Aegir’s Gold slightly shines with a silvery light that can be perceived easily. An Aegir’s Gold loses its properties and becomes a normal gold piece at the next dawn.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to conjure the darkness of the deep seas.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the power of the deep seas. Colors and sounds are distorted as if they were coming from dozens of feet beneath the water surface within a 60-foot radius centered on you. Up to 5 creatures you select in the area must make Wisdom saving throws. On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage and becomes frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects on itself on a successful one. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not frightened.</p>
			<p class="indent">Also, you can spend 4 Aegir’s Gold as an action to regain one use of your Channel Divinity.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Starting at 6th level, you can conjure Ran’s Net.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, you make a ranged spell attack against a creature within 15 feet of you and throw a conjured net on it. On a hit, the target is restrained for 1 minute and takes 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier necrotic damage at the end of each turn it is restrained this way.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action, the creature can try to rip off the net by making a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to, or get out of it by making a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The net can also be torn; it has 13 AC, 40 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">If a creature dies within the net, it magically disappears, as if pulled into the sea. Any valuable items the creature carries remain on the ground, with splatters of dried, greenish blood on them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, Ran accepts the slain creature as a sacrifice and grants you 1 Aegir’s Gold that is found in the net after the creature disappears.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest. You can also spend 3 Aegir’s Gold to regain one use.</p>
