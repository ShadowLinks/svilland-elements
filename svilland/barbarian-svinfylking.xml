			<p>Svinfylkings are barbarians who find strength in the spirit of the boar. Sometime in their lives, they snap and prefer to delve into things head on. Whether they decide on revenge against all odds on the raiders who sacked their village, or just get too bored with the rural life and completely abandon it for an unknown journey, they find their answers in a manner of moving ahead by force. They believe in the spirit of the boar as their guide and learn from the movements and habits of these wild creatures.</p>
			<p class="indent">In terms of tactics, they prefer to be the wrecking edge of the axe, charging in before anyone else.The one thing that must be kept in mind about Svinfylkings is their fury; for boars may be angry, but Svinfylkings are angrier.</p>
