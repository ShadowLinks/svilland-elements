			<p>In Svilland, evil lurks around every corner. Most Svillandersare too preoccupied to see it coming before it is too late. This is not true for those who follow the Virtue domain. Gothis of this domain are champions who stand between the innocent and the evildoer. They guard certain places in the name of their deities, wander the realm to find new infestations of evil and to bring them to their knees. Their ways may seem harsh, but they are prepared to do whatever it takes to banish the evil and the wicked from the realm.</p>
