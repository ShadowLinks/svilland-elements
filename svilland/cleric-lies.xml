			<p>The Lies domain serves Lokiâ€™s biggest purpose of acquiring power and chaos through trickery and mischief. Loki surrounds himself with magical tools of illusion, and unpleasant dreams. His hold over distorted reality is one of the things he is most proud of.</p>
			<p class="indent">Those devoted to this domain seek to disrupt anything that has to do with the Allfather. They find and exploit secrets, causing disorder and humiliation among peasants and jarls alike. They are also hard to identify as they hide behind layers of illusions and lies, just as their God does.</p>
