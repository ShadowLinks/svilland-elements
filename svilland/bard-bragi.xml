			<p>Bards that follow the Tradition of Bragi are the classical bardsthat one can see in taverns everywhere. They voyage from town to town and perform to locals in exchange for a place to stay and/or money. They try to learn as many tales, sayings and stories stretching back to eras before Svilland. They are also known for being social chameleons. Bragi bards can be seen as advisers, diplomats, tutors, and even spies of nobles.</p>
