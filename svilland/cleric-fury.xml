			<p>The Fury domain belongs to Fenrir. It focuses on the savage anger that lies within; even inside the most civilized. It promises harmony at the end, when all the beasts serve Fenrir, in return for the aid of the destruction he will cause in Ragnarok.</p>
			<p class="indent">Those devoted to the Fury domain are aware of their savage nature, yearning to hunt and rampage in divine bliss. They are instinctual warriors of nature, no different from the direst of wolves and the largest of bears.</p>
