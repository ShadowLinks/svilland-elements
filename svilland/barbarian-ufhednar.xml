		<description>
			<p>Ulfhednars, those who follow the path of the wolves, are cunning, aware of their surroundings and loyal to their packs. They see value in being in a pack and in thinking on behalf of oneâ€™s community rather than thinking selfishly. Whether they got on the path of the wolf by hanging out as bandits or by hunting foes with their warrior brethren, they see their party members as the members of their pack and try to give them advantages in combat. They believe in the spirit of the wolf to be their guide, and learn from the movements and habits of these wild brethren.</p>
