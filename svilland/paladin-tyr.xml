        <description>
            <p>Alles who swear their oaths to Tyr become the holy warrior-judges of Svilland. They wander from place to place seeking to correct injustice. They act as judges in communities they visit and care for the cases of law in settlements.</p>
			<p class="indent">They are protective of innocent folk and try to aid them in any way they can, especially against bandits or other oppressors. Against criminals and wrongdoers, they act in a cold, merciless manner. They do what the law requires, and do not act according to their humane emotions.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">CHANGES IN FEATURES</h5>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Smite and Improved Divine Smite:</em></strong> You inflict force damage rather than radiant damage with Divine Smite and Improved Divine Smite.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF TYR</h5>
            <p>As Tyr is the warrior God of justice, he requires all of his champions to act in the search for justice as well, and spread his holy duty within the realm. The pillars of Tyr stand on the following tenets:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Protect. </i></b>
                 Always protect and help the innocent in the face of injustice. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Valour. </i></b>
                 Face your opponent and never backstab a foe.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Honesty. </i></b>
                Be fair and be honest. Do not cheat or lie to others, even if they are your enemy.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Justice. </i></b>
                Do what is just. Bring judgement down upon wrongdoers whenever possible.
            </p>
			<p class="indent">
                <b><i>Judgement. </i></b>
                Do not vanquish your foe out of hatred. Even when your opponent falls, make sure it is judged correctly and be aware that it deserves a worthy punishment. A thief stealing bread because it is hungry does not deserve the same fate with a vicious murderer.

			<p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Punish the Wrongdoers. </em></strong>As an action, you accuse a creature threatening the law or threatening innocents. For 1 minute, you attack that creature with advantage. If that creature has recently harmed one of your allies, that ally attacks the creature with advantage as well.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although the GM decides what constitutes a threatening creature, you may use the following definitions for wrongdoers as inspiration: A creature that is acting against the rightful laws of a local or regional ruler, is thus a wrongdoer. A creature that threatens the innocents is also a wrongdoer.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Protection. </em></strong>As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer to protect the innocent in danger. You and friendly creatures within 30 feet of you add 2 to your AC for 1 minute.</p>
