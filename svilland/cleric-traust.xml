			<p>Traust domain focuses on the protection of the devoted from offenders. The Gods and Goddesses grant protection so that their believers survive the challenges of the realm, and so they continue to pass on their holy word.</p>
			<p class="indent">Tyr has this domain because he guides and protects his followers in the neverending battle against injustice. Freyja has this domain to protect her followers and let her devotees protect the weak and sick in her name.</p>
