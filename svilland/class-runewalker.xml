        <description>
            <p>Many many years ago, when the Gods came to these lands, Odin learnt about magic in its raw form. As Odin delved deeper and deeper and uncovered the mysteries of magic, he also began to shape it. He gave the chaotic and raw energies of the world a form and classified them. Finally, he created runes and bestowed them upon the folk of Svilland.</p>
            <p class="indent">Then arose the Runewalkers. They understood that runes are a way of life, and so they made magic and runes a part of their lives. War, farming, traveling and many other mortal concepts gained a runic meaning.</p>
            <h4>A LIFE DEDICATED TO RUNES</h4>
            <p>A Runewalker’s life is an adventurous one. They search for runes so long as they have life in them. Runewalkers appear whenever a rune is found, or wherever they are needed. They never miss a chance to learn more about runes.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A RUNEWALKER</h4>
            <p>You travel and gather runes. You keep the knowledge you’ve discovered, protect it, and think it to be sacred. You choose a runic path (which is different from an archetype) and try to live by it to set an example for other people. For example, if you walk on the Path of the Dead, you can be seen helping a medic in a small village in the daytime, also building on your knowledge of anatomy. The same night, you can be seen exercising your knowledge on the undead that you raised. You should also talk to your GM about your teacher, your master and the origins of your curiosity about runes.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a runewalker quickly by following these suggestions. Intelligence should be your highest ability score followed by Wisdom or Constitution.</p>

        <description>
            <p>As a runewalker, you have a list of runes you know. This list is called a runelist. It can be in the shape of a spellbook, of separate scrolls or of tattoos on your body. The runelist is made up of the wizard spell list plus the runewalker spells given in this book.</p>
            <h4>Cantrips</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you know 3 cantrips of your choice from the wizard and runewalker spell lists. You learn additional cantrips at higher runewalker levels as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Runewalker table.</p>
            <h4>Runelist</h4>
            <p>At 1st level, you have a runelist containing six 1st-level spells of your choice from the wizard and runewalker spell lists.</p>
            <h4>Preparing and Casting Spells</h4>
            <p>The Runewalker table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all your expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You prepare a list of spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of spells from your runelist equal to your Intelligence modifier + your runewalker level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent studying your runelist and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: you must spend at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
            <p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for the spells from your runelist. Memorizing runes, their meanings and remembering spells’ requirements are all related to Intelligence. You also use your Intelligence modifier while determining a spell’s DC and making an attack roll</p>
            <center>
                <p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
                <p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
            </center>
            <h4>Ritual Casting</h4>
            <p>You can cast a spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell on your runelist. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>
            <h4>Spellcasting Focus</h4>
            <p>You can use a rune focus as a spellcasting focus for your spells.</p>
            <h4>Learning Spells of 1st Level or higher</h4>
            <p>Each time you gain a runewalker level, you can add two runewalker and wizard spells to your runelist. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Runewalker table.</p>
            <h4>Your Runelist</h4>
            <p>The runes that you add to your runelist indicate the research you have done. You might find other runes during your adventures. You could discover new runes among your enemies’ notes, in a ruined temple during political wars or in eldritch places dating back to ancient times.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Adding a rune onto the list.</em></strong> When you find a new rune, you can add it to your runelist if it is of a level for which you have spell slots. Also, you need the time to understand the rune, and material to add it to your runelist.</p>
            <p class="indent">Adding a rune to your runelist involves different steps. These include solving the meaning of the rune, understanding its needs and its nature, and finally, casting it. To master a rune and cast it without error, you have to work on it. All of these steps take 2 hours and 50 gp for each level of the spell. If you want to copy one of the runes from your runelist to another, for instance to your friends’ runelist or your backup runelist, you need to spend 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the rune.</p>

            <p>You can choose different traditions while learning about runes. You can dedicate your life to studies about runes and discover new ways to use them, empower the runes using your own life force, or use the mystical powers of runes to weave magical effects around others. As you grow in power and become a master of the tradition you follow, word spreads of your knowledge and might. Your reputation seems to precede you wherever you go.</p>

            <p>You see runes as a path in life that one walks on. After you learn about runes and runic magic, you choose a rune path. You know that life has many ways to go about things, many choices; and so do runes.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>At 10th and 18th levels, you choose 1 additional rune path (different from the ones you chose so far).

            <p>Runes have mystic powers and one of them can be interpreted as “sealing”. Sealing things carry different meanings. You can seal a chest, a door, a lockbox, or you can seal someone’s luck and fate.</p>

            <p class="indent">In addition, when your target makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can try to seal its fate as a reaction. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or the result of its roll counts as 1. You can only use this feature before the target makes the roll. You can use this feature once per week.</p>
