			<p>Kaun-touched sorcerers carry with them the rune of Kaun, the fire rune. They are better attuned to spells based on fire. With a wave of their hand, they can burn their foes to a crisp.</p>
			<p class="indent">These sorcerers are fewer in number compared to those touched by Isa. Yet, there are many tales around them because of the terror they wreak on a battlefield as they set it ablaze.</p>

			<p>Starting at 18th level, as an action, you can become an avatar of fire. Your body looks like an erupting volcano, your eyes start to glow with a red or yellow hue, and flame and smoke starts coming out of them. The form lasts for 1 minute, and you gain the following benefits while in this form:</p>
			<ul>
                <li>You gain immunity to fire damage, and vulnerability to cold damage.</li>
                <li>Your steps leave traces of fire and set the ground ablaze. You create a 5-foot-wide line of fire in the track of your movement. The fire remains for 1 minute or until it is extinguished as an action.</li>
                <li>You can hurl flames to a target within 60 feet of you, dealing 2d6 fire damage on a successful ranged spell attack.</li>
                <li>You can intensify your flaming body and create a 5-foot-radius aura of fire. When a creature enters the area for the first time or ends its turn within it, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d10 fire damage.</li>
                <li>As a part of your movement, you instantly combust with a bright explosion, dealing damage to creatures nearby and potentially blinding them. Because of the combustion, you take 9d6 fire damage yourself, which cannot be reduced by any means. Creatures within 10 feet of you take twice that fire damage. An affected creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one).</li>
