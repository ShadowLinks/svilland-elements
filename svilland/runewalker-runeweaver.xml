			<p>Runeweavers focus on the mystical powers of the runes. They think that the universe is based on runes and try to see runes in everything around them. To them, everything is a mystical sign.</p>

			<p>Starting at 2nd level, you start to weave triggering conditions or triggers into runes (spells from your runelist) you cast. For example; you can say, “I weave a shield rune on me. It is automatically activated when I am attacked by a melee weapon attack,” or “I am weaving a fireball rune on the door of my house. When an undead creature touches the door, a fireball spell is cast centered on the point I am designating right now.”</p>
			<p class="indent">Weaving a spell is a 10-minute ritual and requires you to expend a spell slot as though you were casting the spell normally. The ritual also consumes the spell components that are required to cast the spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">A weaved spell lasts for 2 hours or until it is triggered. You cannot weave a spell of 6th level or higher, and you can only weave spells of which the casting time is an action, a bonus action, or a reaction. For spells that require a target, you need to specify a target. For spells that affect an area, you need to specify its point of origin. The distance between the point of origin and the point you weave the spell on must be equal to or lower than the rune’s range.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest to use it again.</p>
