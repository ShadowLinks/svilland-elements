			<p>The archetypal Vikingr are professional raiders. They sail away to far seas with the hope that they have the favor of Gods and Goddesses - especially Aegir, Thor, and Ran - and with the wish of a sea chest full of plunder in their minds. They excel in coordinated and devastating raids, especially in those at sea. Those who train to become a vikingr know the importance of morale alongside their strength to become victorious in combat.</p>
