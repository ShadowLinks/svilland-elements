            <p>Alles who swear an oath to Thor carry with them their God’s thunderous might. Walking in their sacred path, they always seek new challenges and foes that seem worthy for them to best.</p>
			<p class="indent">They show no mercy to the opponents of their God, especially to jotunns. Some of them have heard the stories of Odd and Black Winter and are preparing themselves for the fight that the folks of Svilland will give against hordes of frost and despair.</p>

			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF THOR</h5>
            <p>Thor’s ideals involve challenge, courage, valour, and wrath. Although they may vary slightly from one town to the other, alles of Thor share these tenets:</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Honesty. </i></b>
                Only the cowards lie. Stay bold in your words and actions. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Courage. </i></b>
                Never back down in the face of danger. Know that the thunder of Thor within you will smite your foes.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Challenge. </i></b>
                Do not appreciate foes that are lesser than you. Seek and find those who think they can best the champion of thunder.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Respect. </i></b>
                Those who work for their brethren and traditions deserve your respect, those who try to betray them, deserve none.esc
