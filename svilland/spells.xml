        <description>
            <p>You choose a point within range, and cause an avalanche to fall, covering a 50-foot radius. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage and 6d8 cold damage. Large or smaller creatures must succeed on another Strength saving throw or be buried under the snow. If so, it takes a creature 10 Actions to reach the surface. On a successful save, a creature is not buried in the snow and takes half damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">The avalanche deals maximum damage to constructs, structures, and terrain features (trees, vegetation, etc.). The avalanche remains until it melts naturally. If the avalanche melts instantly, this causes a flood that acts as a river with a width of 20 feet. A creature in contact with the ground within the area must succeed on a Strength saving throw to keep from falling into the flood, or on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid it, or be carried 30 feet away and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.</p>

            <p>When you make a hit that kills a creature with a challenge rating of 2 or higher, you can dedicate the kill to your deity. As a reward, your deity sends a guardian to your aid.</p>
            <p class="indent">The guardian shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It has AC 16 and 40 hit points. On each of its turns, it must spend its action to make one melee spell attack dealing 1d10 force damage, or to cast the cure wounds spell healing 2d8 + 4 hit points.</p>

            <p>This spell is considered to be extreme and unnecessary by most Svillanders, but the alle of Hel think that every part of a person (soul and body) should serve a purpose, even after death.</p>
            <p class="indent">By devouring the flesh of a dead humanoid creature, you gain proficiency in the skills in which the creature itself was proficient. In addition, compare your proficiency bonus with that of the creature, and use the higher number as your new proficiency bonus. Also, you can gain access to specific pieces of knowledge the dead creature knew about, such as the place of a specific item or the name of a specific person, at the GM’s discretion.</p>
            <p class="indent">The casting time of the spell cannot be reduced by any means, and the verbal components of the spell must be performed. You must devour the flesh with the proper chant and spend the necessary time to cast the spell for it to work.</p>

            <p>You think of a creature you have seen before. Then, you create horrors in your mind and unleash them into the mind of the creature, offering your own peace as payment. To do this, you chant incantations for 1 hour. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, neither you nor the target can rest for the next 8 hours. On a successful save, both you and the target can rest normally.</p>

            <p>The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack before the spell ends, you deal an extra 4d8 damage of the weapon’s damage type. If your weapon has more than one damage type, you choose the damage type of the extra damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability against the damage type of the extra damage dealt with this spell until the end of its next turn.</p>
