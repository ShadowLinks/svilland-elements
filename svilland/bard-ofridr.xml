		<description>
			<p>Bards from the Tradition of Ofridr are warrior-bards and battle chanters. They see fighting as a type of performance like any other artform; or more truthfully the best of them all. They find themselves happily lost in the throes of ecstasy when in battle, and they share this feeling with their allies. Although they are not trained like fighters or raised like barbarians, their unique gift for performance makes them invaluable in battle. A charge of Svillanders is a horrific and glorious sight but an attack accompanied with an Ofridr bard is a display that the valkyries would definitely take notice of.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you become an essential member of your warband and create a unique dynamic within it. You and up to five warband members within 60 feet of you, gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>
			<p class="indent">You have to share a deep connection with a creature to count them as warband members. This means that this feature only involves other PCs in your party, and perhaps a couple of NPCs and animal companions outside your party (at the GMâ€™s discretion).</p>
			<p class="indent">This bonus increases to +2 at 10th level.</p>
