    <element name="Storm Finder, Last Memory of Ragnarok" type="Magic Item" source="Svilland" id="ID_DRS_SVILLAND_MAGIC_ITEM_STORM_FINDER_LAST_MEMORY_OF_RAGNAROK">
        <description>
            <p>Once upon a time, an oracle named Halvar had a vision of Ragnarok. In his vision, he saw a staff enchanted with thunder and lightning save the Asgardians just as all seemed lost. He searched for the staff far and wide for years on end until one night, he had another vision in which he himself was crafting it. Halvar thus spent the rest of his life searching for the best materials with which he crafted this masterpiece of a staff piece by piece. Alas, he died before he could use it, and before he could give it to those who would do so when the time came. The staff is still somewhere out there, waiting to be found to fulfill its destiny.</p> 
            <p class="indent">This staff has 10 charges. You can cast any spell that deals lightning or thunder damage by expending a number of charges equal to the level of the spell slot you used. The staff regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you stay in a stormy area for 1 hour, the staff regains 3 additional charges.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. If you roll a 5 or lower, you have a vision of Ragnarok. The vision deals 3d6 psychic damage to you and this damage canâ€™t be lowered by any means.</p>
