			<p class="flavor">The Agony Domain</p>
			<p>The Mein domain focuses on the struggle of Balder in Helheim. The domain came to be once Balder fell to Helheim. It involves the spreading of the pain and suffering that a God himself is subject to.</p>
			<p class="indent">His followers do not run away from pain; they endure it to understand the essence of Balder. Those who follow the Mein domain can channel this pain onto others, and make them experience and understand it as well.</p>
