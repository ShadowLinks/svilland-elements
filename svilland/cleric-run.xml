			<p class="flavor">The Rune Domain</p>
			<p>The Rûn domain taps into the powers of the master of runes; Odin the Allfather. Although this domain does not concern rune magic used by other rune casters, it does involve the magical essence within runes. The very connection between magic and the divine is imitated by this domain</p>
			<p class="indent">Those devoted to this domain wander the realm to train themselves in the mystical ways of Odin and act as wardens of the reign of magic in Svilland. They look for all kinds of magic to understand their nature, and use them to their advantage in the Allfather’s name.</p>
