            <p>You can choose to attack recklessly when you use a Svillander axe. Decrease your attack roll by 1d4 and increase the damage by 1d4. In addition, if a creature that is within 5 feet of you rolls a 1 on a weapon attack roll against you while you are wielding this weapon, or if you roll a 20 on an attack roll against a creature wielding a shield, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check as a reaction (DC equal to the creatureâ€™s AC) to disarm the creature, taking away its weapon or shield by hooking it with your axe on a success.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time in Thorath, a group of priests decided to make something to help Thor in his final battle in Ragnarok. They travelled all across Svilland and collected materials to craft the best weapon they could. After 5 years, they returned to Thorath and crafted a longsword.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wielding this item, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You have immunity to lightning damage.</li>
                <li>When targeted by a spell or another magical effect that deals lightning damage, roll a d20. If you roll an 18 or higher, the sword absorbs the damage and you can cast the lightning bolt (DC 15) spell as a bonus action on your next turn.</li>
                <li>As an action, you can thrust this sword into the ground. When you do so, it discharges a blast of lightning in a 60-foot radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 5d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The sword remains in the ground for 3 turns and cannot be pulled out by any means.</li>

            <p>n the black markets of Alsvartr, there are some swords that change hands too quickly. There are rumors that once you own this sword, all you can think about is getting rid of it, although no one knows why. When asked, previous owners simply say it messed with their heads.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wielding this magic weapon, you can cast the banishment and black tentacles spells. Once you cast one of them, you must finish a long rest to cast it again.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Curse.</em></strong> If you refuse to spill blood once you unsheathe the sword, you must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, the sword speaks to you, telling you that you need to sell it or give it away. You must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw just after your next long rest or you make an attack roll against the nearest creature.</p>

            <p>These swords are two emotionally opposite and unpredictable magic weapons. The left sword has little holes on it with tiny needles inside, and the right sword has a green gem placed on it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The left sword is filled with fury and wants you to defeat your foes whereas the right sword seeks to protect you and makes sure that you are not in your final battle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Although powerful, many people donâ€™t want to use these swords since they are unpredictable. The set must be 100 feet within each other or both swords lose their properties and become +1 weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">While wielding these swords, roll a d20 before you roll initiative. If the result is 11 or higher, the left sword deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage on a hit and the right sword heals you by 1d6 at the end of each of your turns, both until the battle ends. If you roll a 10 or lower, the left sword deals 1d4 piercing damage to you at the beginning of each of your turns you keep holding it and the right sword grants you a +1 bonus to AC</p>

            <p>This sword is part of a myth of Iron Lake (p. 63).</p>
            <p class="indent">People say that this is the only sword thrown into the lake that the lake threw back. It is said that a warrior threw her sword into the lake one day, as many had done for years. This time, however, the sword would not sink. No matter how many times she threw it in, the sword washed up on the shore again and again. People thus believed that the sword or the warrior was cursed. It later turned out that the sword was simply made from a different material preventing it from sinking like the other weapons.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you hit with an attack using this weapon, your attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.</p>
