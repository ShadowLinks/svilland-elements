			<p class="flavor">The Smith Domain</p>
			<p>The Smidr domain focuses on the civilization of Svilland that was born when the first hammer hit the first anvil. With it, the divine knowledge of the crafters was brought to the devoted, and this helped build the tools for a well-adjusted society. Those who follow the Smidr domain are prone to rule over magic items with their divine powers. They know more about and are more familiar with various treasures found in the realm compared to regular artisans.</p>

			<p>Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to block the power of a magic item. As an action, you can target a magic item you can see within 30 feet of you, and suppress its magical properties for 1 minute. If it is held, worn, or wielded by a creature, the creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. If you try to suppress the properties of a sentient magic item, you must also make a successful spell attack against its spell save DC (if it has) to suppress its features.</p>
