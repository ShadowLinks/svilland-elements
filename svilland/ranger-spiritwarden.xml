			<p>Land spirits are an important part of Svilland’s nature. As they are magically attuned to nature, some rangers develop a special connection to such spirits.</p>
			<p class="indent">These rangers are called spirit wardens and are initiated to magic and guided in the ways of being a ranger by these spirits.</p>
			<p class="indent">It is common for rangers to find their way in nature, but spirit wardens carry the essence of nature within. Thus, they gain special benefits according to their respective regions.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, you gain one of the following benefits, depending on your land spirit:</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Forest. </em></strong>You conjure a venomous ethereal viper that comes out of your fingertips and strikes an opponent of your choice within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 poison damage and makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes additional 1d4 poison damage at the start of each of its turns and is poisoned for 1 minute. It can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mountain. </em></strong>You make the earth under a creature within 30 feet of you crumble and crack. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or fall in the crack and take 2d10 bludgeoning damage. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the creature is also stuck in the fissure and falls prone. In order to get out of the crack, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against the same DC at the start of each of its turns.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sea. </em></strong>If an ally within 15 feet of you is the target of an attack and the attacker is within 60 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a ranged spell attack against the attacker. On a hit, you send a furious sea wave its way and the target takes 2d8 force damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
