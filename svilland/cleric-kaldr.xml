			<p>The Kaldr domain involves not only the usual cold or essence of cold in the realm, but also the unearthly and unholy cold of Helheim. It is related to Black Winter, the event feared by all of Svilland.</p>
			<p class="indent">Through this domain, Hel unleashes her frost onto the realm to make her victims suffer. Those who are devoted to this domain care about freezing all their foes to death, and imprisoning them in an eternal struggle.</p>

A creature takes 8d6 cold damage and 4d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
