			<p>Some deities scheme to bring about the end of Svilland. Among their many minions, they search for those who are worthy of wielding their power.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Wicked domain focuses on everything that is wicked in the eyes of Odin and his pantheon and in the eyes of the realm. Those devoted to this domain spread ill thought wherever they go.</p>
			<p class="indent">Just as their deities, they scheme within the shadows or act as tyrants, holding dominion over the weak. They love to see those in power and those who are blessed by The Allfather go down and suffer.</p>
